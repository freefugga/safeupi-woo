Accept UPI payments in WooCommerce using SafeUPiâ€™s SaaS service. Customers are redirected to a secure payment page with a dynamic QR code and then returned after payment. Works with Checkout Blocks.

- Order status is updated automatically via webhook

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No. The plugin redirects users to a SafeUPi-hosted page where the QR is generated dynamically.
